Simple code. Main application logic written on javaScript. Server side(c#) used
	only for storing to database and render page.
	Perfectly working on “firefox” and chrome,
	rendering beautifully 3d graphs in real-time, as needed.
	


	All the basic logic of the program is in two files: 
	~/Views/Shared/_ScriptsPartial.cshtml
	~/Scripts/project-functions.js

	~/Scripts/project-graphics.js, project-tables.js - implementation Schedule
	
	
	Charts used: highcharts http://www.highcharts.com/demo/3d-column-stacking-grouping
